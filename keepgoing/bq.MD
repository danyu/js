### "Tell Me About Yourself" (TMAY)
```Start with one or two sentences as high level comprehensive layout.```
I am a motivated front end software engineer, enthusiastic about createing customer facing application. Have 5 years of industrial Majority of that have been spent working on both backend and frontend. Capable of creating flexible and extendable solutions. Was able to delievery under pressure and strict timeline.
I have worked on different platforms. I am focusing on UI development.


```Highlight some key skills and competencies```

### Why do you want ot work here?
* Be a part of big picture
* Bigger impact to customer
* Find my potential

### Tell a time you had conflict at work
```Basic formulas: S(Situation)-T(Task)-A(Action)-R(Result)```
-> Personal conflicts. 
General approach
(1) Face to face talking if could be addressed personally.
(2) Report to manager if conflicts could impact team.
E.g., Early stage of Walmart, works got re-assinged to me unreasonablely and frequently, I feel wired becuase those work were not hard, so reach out to manager to see if can adjust work scope for that person.

-> Technical conflicts.
General approach:
(1) Find the reason of conflcts, mostly caused by my soluton versus your solution. 
(2) Compare pros/cons objectively, some POC to find better solutions.
(3) Think as a whole application not my team against your team.
(4) Following through even if resolving conflicts become others' responsiblity.  
* Example (1): Implement new query syntaxy need.
   * * Conflicts: UI heavy changes vs UI and backend both lightweight changes.
   * * Strategy: First i understand that I communicated with backend developer to list the pros and cons for each solution. Narrow down the conficts 
       



### Tell me a mistake you made at work
```Note: Pick be a real mistake```
->Example (1): Feature was rolled out before dependency is ready.
 Situation:
 Task: Deliever a feature that has multiple layer of dependencies.
 Why? What is missed: (a): First layer / direct dep is in prod. 
                      (b) Second layer / indirect dep is not in prod.
                      (c) Caused unexpected behavior. 
 It got captured during sanity checking. But the feature is toggled and was able to be turned off it on time before it was anounced.

### Tell me about a time you had to meet a tight deadline
```STAR, and list some actual actions```
->Example (1): Help to speed up Audit Logging
Situation = Two weeks to close a feature that was suddendly requested by manager
Task = Finalize data structure, UI components
Actions/General strategies =
 (1) Clarify the requirements avoid jumping to implementation too soon even if time is limited.
 (2) Get the bottom line. 
      a. Have to have a very clear understanding what need to delivered the most if the whole feature can not be made
      b. Split into small tasks and prioritize them
      c.  
 (3) Quality assurance. 
      a. Catching a tight deadline can cause errors. Need to make sure the feature is toggled and can be turned off / rolled back.
Results:
 (1):
